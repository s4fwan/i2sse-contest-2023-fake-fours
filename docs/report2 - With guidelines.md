# Final Report jj

Before the deadline, download a PDF version of this report, and submit it on iLearn. We will mark the report uploaded on iLearn.

Use the structure below for your report. Remove line 3 and 5 of the markdown file.

## Introduction
Provide a description of the topic, including what the two programs will do and what users can expect from them.

The two programs our group created includes a cucumber jumping and a judge. The first program shows the suers a cucumber moving across the screen from left to right and then back again. The users can interact with it by clicking on the cucumber to make it jump up and then it falls back to the ground while it continues to travel across the screen. The second program shows a judge moving across the screen randomly. Users can click on the judge which causes it to sit and if they click again while it’s sitting the judge will stand up. If the users click anywhere but the judge, it will continue with its previous actions and no change will occur. The two programs together make an interactive game which involves the cucumber being covered by the judge. In this game the cucumber will move across the screen and will jump without the user interacting with it, but the user will be able to use their keyboards to control the judge to run around the screen and jump. The users will have to prevent the cucumber covering the judge by interacting with the judge. If the cucumber covers the judge, the judge will lose health. Once the judge loses all its health the program will end. The game also features music to make it more enjoyable. 

## User Manual
Provide a detailed user manual that describes how to interact with your animation.

-	User runs cucumber program. 
-	Animation of cucumber moving across the screen will appear when the user runs the program. 
-	User clicks to interact with the cucumber. When the user interacts with the cucumber it jumps and falls back to the ground.

-	User runs judge program.
-	Animation of a judge walking across the screen appears. 
-	User clicks to interact with the judge. When the user clicks on the judge it will sit and when user clicks on the judge it will stand 

-	User runs cucumber and judge program.
-	Judge and cucumber appear. 


## Design and Architecture
Please include a graphical representation of the architecture of your program, illustrating how its primary components relate to each other. You may omit certain details to ensure clarity in the diagram. It is meant to give an overview, rather than a complete picture.

## User Acceptance Tests
- List the user stories and requirements that were the source for the user acceptance tests.

User stories:
-	As a user, I want to see an animation of a JUDGE.
-	As a user, I want to interact with a JUDGE, so that it sits and stands.
-	As a user, I want to see a JUMPING CUCUMBER.
-	As a user, I want to interact with a CUCUMBER, so it is JUMPING.
Requirements:
-	Show an animation of a JUDGE 
-	Show an animation of a CUCUMBER 

- Describe your test plan.
- Report on the outcome of the user acceptance test, including an overview of the tests and whether they passed or failed.

## System Test
- List the user stories and requirements that were the source for the system tests.

User stories:
-	As a user, I want to see an animation of a JUDGE.
-	As a user, I want to interact with a JUDGE, so that it sits and stands.
-	As a user, I want to see a JUMPING CUCUMBER.
-	As a user, I want to interact with a CUCUMBER, so it is JUMPING.
Requirements:
-	Show an animation of a JUDGE 
-	Show an animation of a CUCUMBER 

- Describe your test plan.
- Report on the outcome of the system test, including an overview of the tests and whether they passed or failed.

## Unit Tests
- Select at least four important components of your animation, and describe the unit tests for these components. Describe them per component.

-	Image of a cucumber (can users see the image/ is it moving across the screen)
-	Cucumber interaction (can users interact/ does the cucumber do what is required)
-	Image of a judge (can users see the image/ is it moving)
-	Judge interaction (can users interact/ does the judge do what is required)
The image of the cucumber moving across the screen was the first important animation our team worked on. The first test it has to pass was if the cucumber image was visible to the users when the run the code. 

- Describe how you selected test cases, and how you ensured sufficient coverage.
- Report on the outcome of the test, including how many passed or failed.

## Project Management
- Describe the roles and responsibilities of the team members that were agreed on before the sprint commenced.

The roles our teamed agreed on during week 8 when the sprint commenced include Safwan as our SCRUM master and Allen as our Product Owner. Safwan was the most appropriate choice as our SCRUM master as he has a deep understanding surrounding GitHub and possesses a lot of good group leader qualities. 

- Describe the processes that you defined before the sprint to ensure software quality.
- Provide your "Definition of Done."

DoD:
-	All user story and acceptance criteria is met 
-	Requirements are met
-	No errors in code and code is complete and runs
-	All unit tests are passed 
-	All to dos on board are completed or identified as failed if unable to complete 
-	All documentation is up to date
-	All team members approve of what’s been completed


## Retrospective
Document the outcome of the retrospective, including:
- Which roles worked well and which could have been improved?

The role of SCRUM master worked very effectively especially having Safwan filling this role as he was very organised and would the group by demonstrating to other members how to complete tasks and guiding them through activities to help everyone to gain more knowledge on using GitHub and Processing. By doing this our group gained new skills and advanced any existing skills we had. 

- Which processes worked well and which could be improved?
What advice would you give to students next year?

-	Start assignments and reports early 
-	Create plans and set goals (e.g., weekly goals and long-term goals such as completing assignments early)
-	Communicate with group regularly and have a way communicating outside of class that all members have access to.
