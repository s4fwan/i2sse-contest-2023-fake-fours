# Interim report

## Introduction

Our project will provide code that shows two images / animations. The first code will show a cucumber jumping up and down on the screen. The second code will provide an animation of a custom drawn judge.
## User Stories and Requirements

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an animation of CUCUMBER, so that I can play with it

**User Story Acceptance Criteria:** 
- Given the Processing Program, when the user presses the play button, then a JUMPING CUCUMBER appears. 
- Given a running program, when the user clicks on the CUCUMBER, then the CUCUMBER stops JUMPING.

**Requirement:** Show an animation of JUDGE

**Requirement Acceptance Criteria:** 
- JUDGE is easily recognisable
- The figure is animated
- The user can interact with the figure

## User Acceptance Tests
- JUDGE must be recognisable 
- CUCUMBER must be recognisable
- JUDGE must be animated
- CUCUMBER must be animated
- CUCUMBER has to be JUMPING
- When User clicks on CUCUMBER, it stops JUMPING
- When CUCUMBER passes boarder, it will reappear on opposite sides at the same x or y coordinates
- When JUDGE passes boarder, it will reappear on opposite sides at the same x or y coordinates

## Coding Guidelines
 - General Java coding convention
 - Use meaningful names for variables
 - camelCase for variable names
 - Final variable names in UPPER_CASE
 - 4 space indentations (one Tab in processing)
 - Leave space between functions
 - Use brackets whenever possible
 - Add single-line and multi-line comments to explain the code
 
## Project Management
 - List the tasks and issues that are currently on your project board, and their status. Include who has been assigned to do the job, and who will be responsible for reviewing the tasks before it is moved to the `Done` column.
 - Explain which methods you will use for code review. Note, that reviewing a task, and reviewing code, are two separate activities.
 - Explain the overall progress with respect to the mid-semester milestone.
