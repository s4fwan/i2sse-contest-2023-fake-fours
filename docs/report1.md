# Interim report

## Introduction

Our project aims to demonstrate the creative potential of our programming skills and our team's
ability to collaborate and work together to achieve a complex goal. 
We achieved this through the implementation of two Processing animations.

The first animation features a "Jumping Cucumber." Where a cucumber is animated to be moving
across the screen and will jump up and down through user interaction. 

The second animation features a "Judge." Where a pixel-art style judge is animated to be walking
left and right randomly, within the window area. The user can interact with the judge to make
it sit and stand up.

Further technical information about the repository and code can be found in the README.MD file.

## User Stories and Requirements

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an animation of CUCUMBER, 
so that I can play with it

**User Story Acceptance Criteria:** 
- Given the Processing Program, when the user presses the play button, then a CUCUMBER appears. 
- Given a running program, when the user does nothing, then the CUCUMBER is moving across the screen.
- Given the CUCUMBER is moving across the screen, when it goes off-screen, it will reset and appear again from the start position.
- Given a running program, when the user clicks, then the CUCUMBER JUMPS.

**Requirement:** Show an animation of JUDGE

**Requirement Acceptance Criteria:** 
- JUDGE is easily recognisable
- The figure is animated to be walking about randomly
- The user can interact with the figure so that it sits in place
- The user can interact with the sitting JUDGE so that it starts moving again

## User Acceptance Tests

**Test ID:** SysCucumber01 <br>
**Test Description:** Does a CUCUMBER appear when program is ran? <br>
**Test Steps:**
- Start the program 
- Observe 

**Expected Outcome:** You see a CUCUMBER clearly on the screen.

**Test ID:** SysCucumber02 <br>
**Test Description:** Does the CUCUMBER move across the screen and then reappear at starting position? <br>
**Test Steps:**
- Start the program 
- Wait and observe 

**Expected Outcome:** You see a CUCUMBER clearly moving across the screen, then resetting once it goes off-screen.

**Test ID:** SysCucumber03 <br>
**Test Description:** Does the "JUMPING" mechanism work> <br>
**Test Steps:**
- Start the program 
- Click on, or next to the CUCUMBER

**Expected Outcome:** The CUCUMBER does one jump, then continues moving.

**Test ID:** SysJudge01 <br>
**Test Description:** Does a JUDGE appear when program is ran? <br>
**Test Steps:**
- Start the program 
- Observe 

**Expected Outcome:** You see a JUDGE clearly on the screen.

**Test ID:** SysJudge02 <br>
**Test Description:** Does the "JUDGE walking" mechanism work? <br>
**Test Steps:**
- Start the program 
- Observe 

**Expected Outcome:** You see the JUDGE walking left and right randomly, and not going off screen.

**Test ID:** SysJudge03 <br>
**Test Description:** Does the "JUDGE sitting" mechanism work? <br>
**Test Steps:**
- Start the program 
- Click on the JUDGE

**Expected Outcome:** You see the JUDGE stop moving, and it's seen to be sitting.

**Test ID:** SysJudge04 <br>
**Test Description:** Does the "JUDGE standing" mechanism work? <br>
**Test Steps:**
- Start the program 
- Click on the JUDGE to make it sit
- Click on the JUDGE again

**Expected Outcome:** You see the JUDGE stand back up and walk around randomly.

## Coding Guidelines
 - General Java coding convention
 - Use meaningful names for variables
 - camelCase for variable names
 - Final variable names in UPPER_CASE
 - 4 space indentations (one Tab in processing)
 - Leave space between functions
 - Use brackets whenever possible
 - Add single-line and multi-line comments to explain the code
 
## Project Management
 - List the tasks and issues that are currently on your project board, and their status. Include who has been assigned to do the job, and who will be responsible for reviewing the tasks before it is moved to the `Done` column.
 - Explain which methods you will use for code review. Note, that reviewing a task, and reviewing code, are two separate activities.
 - Explain the overall progress with respect to the mid-semester milestone.
